## About me
**WordPress Developer Based in Bali, Indonesia**

I’m Putu Adi, a WordPress specialist who builds websites and web apps for business owners who want results, not just a launch.

If your website feels like a brochure, looks fine but doesn’t bring leads, or gets traffic that never converts, the problem is rarely the design, it’s the lack of strategy. I build WordPress websites around your business goals and your target audience, so the site is structured to attract the right traffic, guide visitors through a simple funnel, and turn them into customers.

Based in Bali, Indonesia. Available for global clients with budget friendly rates.

## How I work
