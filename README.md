## About me
**WordPress Developer Based in Bali, Indonesia**

I’m Putu Adi, a WordPress specialist who builds websites and web apps for business owners who want results, not just a launch.

If your website feels like a brochure, looks fine but doesn’t bring leads, or gets traffic that never converts, the problem is rarely the design, it’s the lack of strategy. I build websites around your business goals and your target audience, so the site is structured to attract the right traffic, guide visitors through a simple funnel, and turn them into customers.

Based in Bali, Indonesia. Available for global clients with budget friendly rates.

## What I do
I help business owners turn Website into a real business asset, a website that is easy to manage, built to scale, and designed to generate results.

- **Build websites that sell**, not just look good, clear structure, funnel ready pages, and conversion focused UX
- **Create custom features** that match your business workflow (not forcing your business to fit a generic template)
- **Develop WordPress web apps** like dashboards, internal tools, and simple CRM style modules when your business needs more than a normal site
- **Optimize speed and stability** so your site loads fast, stays reliable, and feels professional to customers
- **Improve security** with practical hardening to reduce risk and keep your business safe
- **Customize WooCommerce for services** so you can sell service packages smoothly, not only physical products
- **Connect the tools you already use**, payments, WhatsApp flows, forms, analytics, and marketing tracking

## How I work
I work in a way that keeps things clear for you as a business owner, so you always know what we’re building, why it matters, and what result to expect.

- **Goal first**, we define the outcome you want (leads, sales, bookings, trust) before touching design or pages
- **Audience and funnel driven**, we structure pages and flow to guide visitors into taking action
- **Clear scope and milestones**, so timelines, priorities, and deliverables stay predictable
- **Built for long term use**, clean, maintainable structure so updates and new features won’t break everything
- **Practical, not complicated**, we use what’s needed to win, without over engineering your website

## Core stack (by choice)
I keep the stack focused and proven, so your website stays stable, fast, and easy to maintain long term.

- **WordPress (PHP)** for flexible, scalable business websites and custom features
- **MySQL** for reliable data handling (customers, orders, leads, internal modules)
- **JavaScript** for smooth interactions and better user experience
- **Bootstrap 5** for clean, responsive layouts that work across devices
- **WordPress REST integrations** when your website needs to connect with external tools and services


---

## Current focus
Right now I’m focused on helping business owners run smoother operations with web based systems, not by adding more complexity, but by turning repetitive work into simple systems.

- **Replacing manual workflows** (spreadsheets, chats, scattered notes) with structured web based systems dashboards and tools
- **Building reusable modules** so new websites and features can be delivered faster, while staying consistent and reliable
