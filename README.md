**WordPress Developer, 🇮🇩 Bali Indonesia**

I build fast, reliable WordPress websites and WordPress based web apps for business owners in Indonesia and worldwide.

My focus is simple, Website built for outcomes, not just pages.

---

## What I do
I specialize in building and maintaining WordPress systems that are clean, scalable, and easy to manage.

- Custom WordPress development (themes, plugins, custom features)
- WordPress based web apps (dashboards, internal tools, CRM like modules)
- WooCommerce customization for service based businesses
- Performance, security hardening, and stability improvements
- Integrations (payments, WhatsApp flows, forms, analytics)

---

## My mission
A lot of people underestimate WordPress, not because WordPress is weak, but because it is often used without understanding its full potential.

I want to prove that WordPress is powerful when built with the right structure, and that it can deliver serious business systems while staying easy for non technical business owners to manage.

---

## How I work
- Business first, I start from goals, workflow, and constraints
- Clear scope and milestones, so delivery stays predictable
- Clean code and maintainable structure, so future changes are safe
- Practical solutions, not over engineered setups

---

## Core stack (by choice)
- WordPress (PHP)
- MySQL
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5
- REST integrations inside WordPress when needed

---

## Current focus
- Building WordPress based systems that replace manual operations (spreadsheets, chats, scattered notes)
- Developing reusable modules for faster delivery across multiple projects
